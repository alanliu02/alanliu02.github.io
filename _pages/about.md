I am a Master's student in Bioengineering at the School of Engineering and Applied Science, University of Pennsylvania, where I focus on medical imaging, biomechanics, and biomedical software development.

My research interests lie at the intersection of biomedical engineering and computational methods, with particular emphasis on:
- Medical image analysis and processing
- Biomechanical modeling and finite element analysis
- Surgical planning systems
- Brain-computer interfaces
- Bioinformatics and big data analysis
